### Motivation to this project was to make application links function properly, and do have the website displayed properly. Deploy a live URl. Add README.md file. The application will load with no errors.

What problem this solved is links function properly and web page is displayed correctly.
I learned how to replace DIVS with different and more correct tags.

#### <link rel="Horiseon" href="file:///Users/dylanquaale/Desktop/Horiseon/index.html">

##### Collaberated with Krister, Asim, Also had a tutoring session with Areyman.

###### Links are working. Webpage is displayed properly.
